# Live-Cricket-Score

--------------->  This is my first experience of writing a script and pushing it onto Git. <------------------


Download the contents in a folder and cd to it.

Run "pip install requirements.txt" in your terminal without the quotes

If it's not working then run this into your terminal:
sudo apt-get install libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev python-dev

Perform the first step again

To run,use:
python2.7 LiveCricketScore.py in the terminal
